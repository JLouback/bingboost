So the idea is the following:

1. User enters query and precision to Interaction.

2. Interaction uses Utils to get results from Bing.

3. Interaction displays results to user, receives and stores feedback.

4. Interaction calls Bingboost (will contain algo) sending the result descriptions, feedback and query.

5. Bingboost returns modified query.

6. Go to 2 and repeat if current precision < desired precision or equal to 0.

Thinking about not modifying original query, we may want a "step back" function if the modified query results in
lower precision.

Went with your idea of a vector instead of separating relevant and non-relevant.
